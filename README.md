<h1><u>Breast Cancer Prediction</u></h1>

<h3>Prediction of Breast Cancer using SVM with <u>99%</u> accuracy</h3>
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer. A few machine learning techniques will be explored. In this exercise, Support Vector Machine is being implemented with 99% accuracy.

##Ideas for more advanced prediction techniques
Here I have experimented only with very basic models, the major reason being the small size of the dataset. If I had more data then I could have experimented with more complex models like ANN, Randomforest Classifier, XGBoost. These could have been used as baseline models in addition to the already implemented ones and the further stacking or even cascading could've been done quiet easily if a larger dataset had been given. 
Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/Saychakr13/Cancer-Diagnosis"><u>ADVANCED CANCER DIAGNOSIS WITH TEXTUAL DATA</u></a> for a greater insight on how to handle such classification problems if you have a decent amount of data.

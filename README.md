# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
Prediction of Breast Cancer using SVM with 99% accuracy
Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Database, we can create a classifier that can help diagnose patients and predict the likelihood of a breast cancer. A few machine learning techniques will be explored. In this exercise, Support Vector Machine is being implemented with 99% accuracy.
